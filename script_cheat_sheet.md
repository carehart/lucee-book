#For IN loop Query

{% gist id="https://gist.github.com/roryl/11c5a5ab8cf061ab1621",file="for_in_query.cfm" %}{% endgist %}

#For IN loop List
The for in construct works with any [List](https://rorylaitila.gitbooks.io/lucee/content/lists.html) that is comma delimited. To change a list to comma delimited, use the ['listChangeDelims()'](http://luceedocs.herokuapp.com/object/string/listChangeDelims) function.

##Array Loop
Usefull for maintaining a reference to the index and the array element

{% gist id="https://gist.github.com/roryl/11c5a5ab8cf061ab1621",file="array_loop.cfm" %}{% endgist %}



##While Loop
{% gist id="https://gist.github.com/roryl/11c5a5ab8cf061ab1621",file="while_loop.cfm" %}{% endgist %}


##Closure
Implements a closure, which passing this function around keeps a reference to the scopes from where it was created

{% gist id="https://gist.github.com/roryl/11c5a5ab8cf061ab1621",file="closure.cfm" %}{% endgist %}


##User Defined Function
User defined functions can be called from anywhere within the script but when they are passed around they do not contain a reference to where they were created
