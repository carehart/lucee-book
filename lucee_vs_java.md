# Lucee vs Java

Lucee is a dynamically typed and interpreted scripting language that runs on the JVM. Lucee is a servlet container application and runs in a servlet container like Tomcat, just as many Java applications do. In fact, Lucee is Java under the hood, compiles to bytecode, and is interoperable with Java in both directions.

Lucee is an Object Oriented Language, with First Class Functions, Closures, a large standard library, and a templating language included, which is much like a JSP tag library. It also includes functional programming features like map & reduce, and being based on Java, has access to the entire Java standard library. Lucee can also load any jars on the classpath and make them available, and also dynamically load jars at runtime.

Lucee 5 includes static functions and properties.
